All that is history.  If you&amp;#039;re ready to stop, there&amp;#039;s a good chance that suboxone will put you on the path of great life again.

I had none of those before Suboxone and spent years abusing oxycontin.  My paycheck was already spent by the time I got it and I started resorting to scheming and stealing to fund my addiction.  All that is history.  If you&#039;re ready to stop, there&#039;s a good chance that suboxone will put you on the path of great life again.
